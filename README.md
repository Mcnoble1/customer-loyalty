I built Loycus (Loyal Customers) which is a decentralized application powered by smart contracts. It was built with Reach and deployed on the Algorand Blockchain.
We have a Platform token (LYC) which is awarded to customers when they perform specific tasks on our platform and customers/users can as well redeem the tokens they earn by purchasing higher membership levels and benefits and also mint NFTs in our marketplace.
Here are the Features available on our Platform.
Enrollment
Customers can enroll into the loyalty program and receive the enrollment token amount in their dashboard wallet. This is achieved by attaching to the smart contract info. Both the Customer and Admin are notified about the enrollment event.
Academy
Users earn tokens when they learn about web3 and Blockchain by taking tutorials and answering quizzes on our platform. The Customer and Admin are both notified about events that occur.
Games
Customers can also play a couple of games on the platform and earn tokens or points. Currently, weâ€™re putting up the Rock Paper Scissors, Fortune Teling, and the Morra Games.
Check-Ins and Anniversaries
Customers receive tokens too each time they check-in to the platform. They receive tokens on anniversaries as well when some length in block time has elapsed.
Referral. (Not yet Implemented)
Customers receive tokens when they refer others to the platform.

Check-Ins and Anniversaries. (Not yet Implemented).
Customers will receive tokens each time they check-in to the application and on their Anniversaries as well say when a length in block time has passed.

Token redemption 
Customers can use the LYC tokens earned on the platform in the following ways.
Membership Levels
Customers can purchase higher level of membership using the tokens accumulated from completing tasks on the platform. We currently have the Bronze, Silver, Gold and VIP membership levels on our platform.
NFT Marketplace
- A mini NFT marketplace and product store where customers can use their tokens to mint NFTs  and purchase products.
Admin
The Admin has a dashboard where they are able to edit and modify reward conditions for giving out tokens to customers. The admin is also notified and able to see all events being performed by the customers that enrolled into the loyalty program that is people that attached to the contract.
I hope to continue working on this project and fully implement all features so as to be useful for people and businesses in the Ecosystem. In the long run, brands and businesses will be able to use our platform for their loyalty program rewards for their customers.
